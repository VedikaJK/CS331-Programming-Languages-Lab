==========================================================

Part A - PI value by Monte Carlo Simulation

Run: java Part_A_180101095.java x
    (x = input number of threads)

Output: Estimated value of PI is output

==========================================================

Part B - Simpson Integral

Run: java Part_B_180101095.java x
    (x = input number of threads)

Output: Estimated value of the integral is output

==========================================================

Part C - Matrix Multiplication

Run: 
1. java Part_C_180101095.java x
    (x = input number of threads)
2. Program will ask the user if he wants to check if value of a cell is correct after multiplication,
    if yes, input row number and col number for the same.

Note: Matrices A and B have been populated with integer values
This can be changed by uncommenting the respective code in run method of Worker_to_initialise class.
However, taking double (float) values might cause cell check to fail due to decimal multiplication
value comparison.
